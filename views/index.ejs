            <p>Hello, welcome to my website, my name is John Aitken, I am a Scottish Mark Master
Mason, a member of Lodge Polmont No793 in Stirlingshire. I have been collecting mark
tokens for over 40 years. I now have a substantial collection, mostly of Scottish tokens but
with a good number from different constitutions worldwide. I have recently started
collecting jewels as well, but faced with the enormous variety I am now trying to
concentrate on Scottish jewels in the hope that I can keep them in Scotland. The items in
my collection are not for sale â€“ they are mine and will remain in my collection. I
occasionally find duplicates which I prefer to swap although I will sell them if I am asked
by a brother who has nothing for swapping.
The dropdown menu labelled tokens will take you to the pictures of my items. Please sign
my guestbook and add your e-mail address which is not visible to anyone but me. Any
comments and suggestions are always welcome.</p>
